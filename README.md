# 🎯 IMCL_MNIST

A Python-based project implementing a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

---

## 📌 Overview

IMCL_MNIST is a comprehensive implementation of a machine learning model trained on the MNIST dataset—a popular benchmark dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project aims to classify and test digit recognition using a custom model.

└── test1.png            # Another sample image for testing
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, etc.)

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sounakss7/IMCL_MNIST.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd IMCL_MNIST
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### ▶️ Run the Project

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `hand_digit.ipynb` and execute the cells to:

   - Preprocess the MNIST dataset
   - Train the machine learning model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Test on sample images (`test.png`, `test1.png`)

## 📊 Model Performance

- Achieves high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix visualization.
